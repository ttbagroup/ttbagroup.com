Pick a make and find the nearest dealership. <br />2. Drive there (or take the bus). <br />3. Compare pricing options, deals, promotions and features. <br />4. Haggle with a salesperson. <br />5.

Half the battle is already won! Business owners had it SO EASY back then!" And you're right! Without easy access to information, consumers had no choice but to come see you at the store. Good for business, not so good for the consumer. <br /><br /> First of all, most people couldn't haggle if their life depended on it. <br /><br /> Most of us can haggle for fruits or other produce at a summer market. It doesn't take a genius to compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges. But comparing a Volkswagen Passat to a Honda Accord can prove more difficult to do. Especially if your adversary is a salesman who has all the up-to-date information about his products while you only know what your uncle told you about his Oldsmobile. Guess who's coming out on top in that transaction. <br /><br /> <em>Do you see where I'm going with this yet? <br /></em><br /> The only reason you went to 10 different car dealerships 30 years ago is because you had no other choice. If you wanted information about a car, you went to a car salesman. If you wanted information about a fridge, a TV or any other product or service, you had to get out of your home and drive to the store. <br /></div></div>

He is now king! He decides when he wants to look for your product, how he does it and where he does it. <br /><br /> But for the most part, they all start in the same place. Here are a few figures: <br />- 81% of shoppers conduct online research before buying <br />- 60% start their research on a search engine like Google <br />- 61% of shoppers read product reviews before making a purchase<br /><a href="http://www.adweek.com/digital/81-shoppers-conduct-online-research-making-purchase-infographic/" style="color:#8585f5 !important;" rel="color:#8585f5 !important;"><span style="color: rgb(95, 113, 245);">(Source)</span><br /></a> <br />By the time a consumer walks into a car dealership in 2017, his mind is already made up! And it's <u>not only cars</u>; it's the same story for the majority of products or services that you will see today! If 30 years ago, the sales cycle started when a customer would walk through the doors, today it starts when the consumer simply feels a need or a want. And with a smart phone in his pocket, he can start looking to fulfill that need within seconds. There's no need to speak with a salesman any more. All of the latest information is easily accessible online. <br /> <br />The dynamic of our work as businesspeople and as salespeople has changed the day that the power of information shifted from us towards the customer. Those who adapted survived and thrived, the rest died out, much like the dinosaurs did. <br /><br /></div></div>            </div>

			<div field="text" class="t-text t-text_md  "><strong><span data-redactor-tag="span" style="font-size: 28px;">Business starts with presence. </span><br /></strong><br /><span style="font-size: 18px;">Being on the first page of Google puts you on the list of companies that will be compared, but it doesn't guarantee contact just yet. Today's consumer will compare a few companies by looking at their overall online presence and then decide which companies he will contact for pricing. (We assume here that your product is the bomb and that your branding is on point.) <br /><br /> When it comes to online presence, here's what you need to think about: <br /> <br /><em>- Do you have a website? Is it mobile responsive? (more than 60% of all purchases start from a mobile device) <br />- Is your contact information visible? <br />- Do you have social media accounts? Are they active? <br />- Do you produce and share interesting and useful content? <br />- Does your business have reviews? How are they? <br />- Have you established yourself as an expert in your field? Can you be trusted? <br />- Do you have a Google My Business account? <br />- Did you come up in Google at all? In Google Ads?</em> <br /><br /> The above list is meant to get you to ask the right questions and start thinking about your business differently. In the next article, we'll look at a more systematic approach to building your marketing funnel and understanding the tools at your disposal at each stage of that model. </span><br /></div>

There's no denying the fact that there are many more companies opening every week, competition is getting more fierce, sometimes international, and the consumer has access to detailed information at the swipe of a finger. <br /> <br />Make no mistake; your competitors are already online. They have been for a while. Online presence is a big step in the right direction but if you haven't made that step by 2017, you're already behind! If your company is not visible online, it is not visible at all. <br /> <br />Be smart about your business. Plan, test, adjust and try again. Leave nothing to chance, be calculated and systematic, use the right tools and target the right audience to grow your business. <br /> <br />If you're not sure where to start, our consultations are free. <u><a href="#GrowMyBusiness" style="color: rgb(11, 11, 11);" rel="" data-redactor-tag="a">Here</a>'s</u> how to get in touch!<br /></div></div>            </div>
